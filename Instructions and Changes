DO THIS before running exmaples/example-Hb.jl:
- Add the Plots package: Pkg: add Plots

To run the StrongField example and play with the parameters:
(1) Open a terminal in the main directory "StrongFieldJAC"
(2) load JAC with the command include("src/jac.jl")
(3) run the StrongField-example with the command include("examples/example-Hb.jl")
(4) Look at the computed energy spectrum that was saved to the file "energy_spectrum.png" in the main directory "StrongFieldJAC"
(5) Change the parameters in "examples/example-Hb.jl" and start again from point (3)


Changes made:
- exmaples/example-Hb.jl
- src/module-Basics.jl          (added definitions for elliptical polarization)
- src/module-BasicsAZ-inc-AG.jl (added definitions for elliptical polarization)
- src/module-Pulse.jl           (added definitions for elliptical polarization)
- src/module-Radial.jl          (added functions GridGL for a "Finite" grid and GridGH)
- src/module-StrongField.jl
